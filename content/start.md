# LAMP Stack
The LAMP stack makes use of the following components:

* **L**inux, the operating system
* **A**pache, the HTTP server
* **M**ySQL, a database, not needed in this use case
* **P**HP, the scripting language

Instead of MySQL, we are using the Virtuoso Database.

## Linux
<i class="fa fa-check fa-fw"></i> Since this virtual machine is based on Linux, this requirement is fullfilled.

## Apache
<i class="fa fa-exclamation fa-fw"></i> If you can see this page, the Apache HTTP server (or your equivalent) is already running sucessfully. Nevertheless, we still need to configure the Apache to make it run OntoWiki. 

## Virtuoso Database
<i class="fa fa-exclamation fa-fw"></i> The Virtuoso can be installed directly from the Ubuntu repositories. To learn how go to the next section.

## PHP
<i class="fa fa-check fa-fw"></i> The pre-installed Apache already comes with PHP.
